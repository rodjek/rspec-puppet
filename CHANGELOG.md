# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [2.7.4]

### Fixed
 * Fix the resource coverage test so that rspec will exit non-zero if the
   desired coverage is not met.

## [2.7.3]

### Fixed
 * Puppet 6 deferred functions are now evaluated and resolved as part of the
   catalogue compilation process.
 * If running with parallel\_tests, the resources that are filtered out of the
   resource coverage report are now taken into account when merging the final
   report, fixing false negative results that can occur.

## [2.7.2]

### Changed
 * Reverted the change introduced in 2.7.0 that reencoded resource parameter
   values to modify their line endings.

## [2.7.1]

### Fixed
 * Fixed a bug that prevented the platform pretending/stubbing logic from being
   temporarily disabled when loading Ruby code.

## [2.7.0]

### Changed
 * Official Puppet 6 support added.
 * When testing resource parameter values, the values received from Puppet are
   now reencoded before testing to ensure that the line endings (if present)
   match the platform being tested.
 * `vendormoduledir` and `basemodulepath` settings (introduced in Puppet 6) are
   now configurable in rspec-puppet.

## [2.6.15]

### Fixed

 * Added a Puppet 6.x adapter so that rspec-puppet does not try to set removed
   Puppet settings (specifically `trusted_server_facts`) when running tests
   against the upcoming Puppet 6.0.0 release.

## [2.6.14]

### Fixed

 * If present, `Win32::Dir` will be used to managed the fixtures directory
   junction on Windows as the builtin `File` module does not have complete
   support for directory junctions on Ruby <= 2.1.

### Changed

 * Resource coverage results are now exposed to the configured RSpec reporter
   rather than only being printed to STDOUT.
 * If running with parallel\_tests, resource coverage data is stored in
   per-process temp files and merged at the end of the final rspec process,
   allowing for a complete coverage report to be generated when splitting
   a test suite across multiple rspec processes.

## [2.6.13]

### Fixed

 * rspec-puppet no longer attempts to set the `trusted_server_facts` Puppet
   setting on Puppet 4.0.0, as the setting was only introduced in Puppet 4.1.0.
 * Automatic `Selinux` stubbing introduced in 2.6.12 no longer assumes the use
   of rspec-mocks. If rspec-mocks is not available, it will fall back to mocha
   and finally fall back to doing nothing if neither is available.

## [2.6.12]

### Fixed

 * Updated `Win32::TaskScheduler` stubs to match the latest release of
   `win32-taskscheduler`.
 * The `os` structured fact is now correctly treated as a Hash when determining
   the platform that rspec-puppet pretends to be.
 * The default resources that Puppet adds to the catalogue (`Class[main]`,
   `Class[Settings]`, etc) are now filtered out of the catalogue when using the
   `have_resource_count` matcher, rather than simply subtracted from the
   resource count. This allows the `have_resource_count` matcher to be used on
   subsects of the catalogue (`exported_resources` for example).
 * When running on Windows, rspec-puppet will now convert Puppet configuration
   settings from `/dev/null` to `NUL`, preventing Puppet from automatically
   creating directories like `C:\dev` when running tests on Windows as an
   Administrator.
 * When overriding fact values, rspec-puppet will now assign the stub facts
   a weight of 1000 to ensure that they override the generated fact values from
   Facter 3.x.
 * `Selinux.is_selinux_enabled` is now automatically stubbed to return 0 to
   disable any SELinux related apply-time validation of resources.
 * When testing against Puppet 3.x, rspec-puppet will now honour the
   `RSpec.configuration.parser` value when determining the module name to set
   up the fixture symlink.
 * When testing for the absence of a parameter using `only_with(:parameter_name
   => nil`), this will no longer incorrectly affect the expected parameter
   count.

## [2.6.11]

### Fixed

 * The `server_facts` hash is now only built if
   `RSpec.configuration.trusted_server_facts` is `true`. Previously, this was
   always built but only used when enabled.

## [2.6.10]

### Fixed

 * Replaced deprecated `File.exists?` calls in `rspec-puppet-init` with
   `File.exist?`, which behaves much more reliably in respect to symlinks.
 * Stubbed out `Puppet::Util::Windows::Security.supports_acl?` when compiling
   the catalogue as this check only make sense when applying the resources to
   a host and prevents testing Windows File resources on non-Windows hosts.
 * The cached default provider for native types is now reset before compiling
   a new catalogue.
 * Resource titles that contain single quotes are now rendered correctly,
   allowing them to be tested.
 * When pretending to be a different platform, the methods in
   `Puppet::Util::Platform` are now stubbed after the catalogue has been
   compiled, allowing path related logic in custom facts to behave as expected.
 * A mock version of `Win32::TaskScheduler` has been added to rspec-puppet.
   This will be loaded when running rspec-puppet on a non-Windows host in order
   to allow testing of catalogues containing Scheduled\_task resources.
 * Stubbed out the `manages_symlinks` feature on
   `Puppet::Type::File::ProviderWindows` as this can only be evaluated at apply
   time and prevents testing Windows File resources that manage symlinks on
   non-Windows hosts.
 * Fixed unhandled exception when testing resource parameters where the
   expected value is an Array or a Hash and the actual value is a different
   data type.
 * A mock version of `Win32::Registry` has been added to rspec-puppet. This
   will be loaded when running rspec-puppet on a non-Windows host in order to
   allow testing of catalogues that contain Exec resources that use the
   `powershell` provider from the `puppetlabs/puppetlabs-powershell` module.
 * Fixed a case where the order in which tests are run can cause a resource
   that is being tested to be falsely reported as untested in the coverage
   report.

### Changed

 * The tests for the `compile` matcher have been updated to support the new
   error message format introduced in Puppet 5.3.4.
 * The builtin `$server_facts` hash is now populated on versions of Puppet that
   support it (Puppet >= 4.3). This is not currently enabled by default, but
   can be enabled by setting `RSpec.configuration.trusted_server_facts` to
   `true`.
 * `$facts['os']['family']` and `$facts['os']['name']` are now checked when
   determining if rspec-puppet needs to pretend to be running on a different
   platform (previously only `$facts['operatingsystem']` and
   `$facts['osfamily']` were used).

## [2.6.9]

### Fixed

 * Initialise Hiera 3 before loading any monkey patches to ensure that the
   correct code is loaded for the actual platform running the tests.

## [2.6.8]

### Fixed

 * Performance regression with Puppet < 4.0.0 due to overly agressive cache
   invalidation.
 * Clarified rspec-puppet-init output when run inside a directory that does not
   contain a `metadata.json` file.

## [2.6.7]

### Fixed

 * An issue where the optional minimum resource coverage check would throw an
   exception when the coverage wasn't 100%.

## [2.6.6]

### Fixed

 * Fixed an issue caused by `Puppet::Util.get_env` when pretending to be a
   Windows host.

## [2.6.5]

### Changed

 * `derive_node_facts_from_nodename` setting added to disable the overriding of
   `fqdn`, `hostname`, and `domain` facts with values derived from the node
   name specified with `let(:node)`.

### Fixed

 * The `trusted_facts` hash now accepts symbol keys, matching the behaviour of
   the `facts` hash.
 * The modifications made to Puppet internals are now contained to rspec-puppet
   examples, preventing them from bleeding out into other examples in the same
   RSpec process (like Ruby unit tests).
 * rspec-puppet no longer attempts to configure settings for Puppet 3.x
   releases that they do not support.

## [2.6.4]

### Fixed

 * A regression that prevented environment names to be specified as a symbol.
 * A regression that prevented the `environmentpath` setting from taking
   effect.
 * Stubbed out the automatic confines created by resource providers on their
   specified commands, which was preventing the correct provider from being
   assigned to a resource when performing cross-platform testing.

## [2.6.3]

### Fixed

 * Facts derived from the node name now only get merged on top of the facts
   specified by `RSpec.configuration.default_facts` and `let(:facts)` if the
   node name has been manually specified with `let(:node)`.

## [2.6.2]

### Changed

 * Puppet 5.0.x added to the CI test matrices.
 * The automatic setup code now checks for the presence of `metadata.json` in
   the working directory. If not present, it assumes that rspec-puppet is
   running from inside a control repo instead of a module and skips creating
   the `spec/fixtures` directory structure and link.

### Added

 * A new configuration option has been added
   (`RSpec.configuration.setup_fixtures`) that controls whether rspec-puppet
   will manage the `spec/fixtures` link.

### Fixed

 * A race condition when running rspec-puppet under parallel\_tests causing
   errors when creating the `spec/fixtures` link.
 * The contents of the `networking` fact hash is no longer cleared when merging
   in the facts derived from the node name.

## [2.6.1]

### Fixed

 * 2.6.0 introduced a change to how resource titles are rendered in the test
   manifest which caused them to get rendered as double quoted strings. This
   caused a failure for tests of defined types that contained `$` characters
   as Puppet would try and interpolate the values in the title as variable(s).

## [2.6.0]

The Windows parity release. rspec-puppet now officially supports Windows. A lot
of work has been put in to support cross-platform tests, so that you can now
test your Windows manifests on \*nix, and your \*nix manifests on Windows.

### Changed

 * Puppet settings are now applied as application overrides, allowing users to
   call `Puppet.settings` directly to make changes to settings without them
   getting clobbered by rspec-puppet.
 * Improved support for setting up the `spec/fixtures/modules` link on Windows
   by using directory junctions instead of symlinks, removing the need for
   Administrator access.
 * When testing for the absence of a parameter on a resource, the error message
   now contains the value(s) of the parameter(s) that should be undefined.
 * When testing a defined type, the defined type being tested is no longer part
   of the coverage report.
 * The cached catalogue will now be invalidated when hiera-puppet-helper users
   change their `hiera_data` value.
 * Multiple instances of a defined type can now be tested at once by providing
   an array of strings with `let(:title)`.
 * Explicitly specifying the type of an example group (`:type => :class`) now
   takes precedence over the type inferred from the spec file's location.
 * The manifest specified in `RSpec.configuration.manifest` (path to `site.pp`
   for Puppet < 4.x) is now imported if specified on Puppet >= 4.x.
 * Puppet functions called when testing a Puppet function now get executed in
   the same scope as parent function.

### Added

 * The module is now automatically linked into `spec/fixtures/modules` at the
   start of the rspec-puppet run.
 * CI testing of PRs on Windows via Appveyor.
 * Support for setting node parameters (mocking the behaviour of an ENC or
   Puppet Enterprise Console) using `let(:node_params)`.
 * Support for injecting Puppet code at the end of the test code using
   `let(:post_condition)`.
 * Resource coverage reports for `host` specs.
 * Puppet functions that take a lambda as a parameter can now be tested by
   chaining `with_lambda` to the `run` matcher.
 * Facts and trusted facts are now available when testing Puppet functions.
 * Hiera configuration can now be specified when testing Puppet functions using
   `let(:hiera_config)`.
 * Trusted facts (`$trusted[]`) can now be specified in
   `RSpec.configuration.default_trusted_facts` or by `let(:trusted_facts)`.
 * `:default` is now a supported parameter value when passed in by
   `let(:params)`.
 * Support for testing Puppet data type aliases.

### Fixed

 * Facts generated from the node name (as set by `let(:node)`) now take
   precedence over the values specified in `RSpec.configuration.default_facts`
   or by `let(:facts)`.
 * Only fact names will now be converted to lowercase, not the fact values.
 * Matchers now support resources where the namevar has a different value to
   the title.
 * Resources created outside of the module being tested by functions like
   `create_resources` or `ensure_package` are no longer present in the coverage
   report from Puppet 4.6 onwards.
 * Guards have been put in place to prevent the possibility of rspec-puppet
   getting stuck in an infinite recursion when testing the relationships
   between resources.
 * A full `spec/spec_helper.rb` file is now written out by `rspec-puppet-init`
   to fix the `fixture_path` issue on new modules.
 * The namevar of a resources is no longer taken into account when testing the
   exact parameters of the resource with `only_with`.
 * Minimum resource coverage check for RSpec <= 3.2.
 * Resource parameters that take a hash as their value will no longer have that
   hash converted into an array.
 * Testing the value of a parameter with a Proc that returns `nil` now works as
   expected.
 * When testing Puppet functions, the function name is no longer automatically
   coverted to lowercase.
 * The value of `$::environment` is now forced to be a string as expected for
   Puppet 4.0 - 4.3.
 * app\_management is no longer enabled by rspec-puppet for Puppet >= 5.0 as it
   is already enabled by default.
 * Failing to provide parameters when testing an application now raises the
   correct exception (`ArgumentError`).
 * Ruby symbols in nested hashes or arrays are now converted into strings when
   passed in by `let(:params)`.
 * Namespaced resources are now correctly capitalised when being added to the
   resource coverage filter.

## [2.5.0]

Headline features are app management, nested hashes in params, and testing for "internal" functions.

Thanks to everyone who contributed: Leo Arnold, Matt Schuchard, and Si Wilkins

### Changed

* Updates to the README
* Improve Gemfile to work with older rubies

### Added

* Add support for app management testing
* Enable nested hashes in params
* After refactoring the function test code, puppet 4 "internal" functions can now be tested too
* Link functions and types on setup
* Increased test coverage

## [2.4.0]

This release now supports testing exported resources in the same way that normal resources in the catalog are tested. Access them in your examples using `exported_resources`. See "Testing Exported Resources" in the README for examples.

### Changed

* This release pulls out much of the version-specific code into separate classes to reduce complexity and enable easier maintenance going forward.

### Added

* Support colon-separated module_path and environmentpath values.
* Support a threshold for the code coverage test, that can fail the whole run.
* Ensure a consistent environment for all examples by adding a forced initialization of puppet before each.

## [2.3.2]

Properly fix yesterday's issue by unsharing the cache key before passing the data to puppet. This also contains a new test matrix to avoid missing a half-baked fix like yesterday.

## [2.3.1]

A quick workaround to re-enable testing with the recently released puppet 3.8.5 and the soon to be released puppet 4.3.2. See PUP-5743 for the gritty details. Upgrade to this version if you hit the "undefined method \`resource' for nil:NilClass" error.

## [2.3.0]

Rspec-puppet now supports testing custom types, `:undef` values in params, structured facts, and checks resource dependencies recursively.

The settings in `module_path` and `manifest` are now respected throughout the code base. The former default for `module_path` (`'/etc/puppet/modules'`) was dropped to avoid accidentally poisoning the test environment with unrelated code.

To reduce the maintenance overhead of boilerplate code, rspec-puppet now provides some of the code that rspec-puppet-init deployed in helper files that you can just `require` instead.

This release also reduces memory usage on bigger testsuites drastically by reducing the caching of compiled catalogs.

### Changed
- Limit the catalogue cache to 16 entries. Significant memory savings and reduced runtime were observed in testing this.
- Prevent Puppet 3's \_timestamp fact from invalidating cache.
- Extracted catalog cache from RSpec::Puppet::Support.
- Updated README to use the rspec 3 syntax, and additional explanations.
- `contain_file(...).with_content(...)` will now only show the diff and not the full contents of the file.

### Added
- Custom type testing example group and matcher.
- before/require/subscribe/notify checking now searches recursively through all dependencies. `File[a] -> File[b] -> File[c]` is now matched by `contain_file('a').that_comes_before('File[c]')`, whereas earlier versions would have missed that.
- `let(:params)` now allows `:undef` to pass a literal undef value through to the subject.
- Support structured facts with keys as symbols or strings (\#295).
- rspec-puppet-init now creates smaller files, using rspec-puppet helpers, instead of pasting code into the module.
- Added a list of related projects to the README.

### Fixed
- Fix #276: `compile.and_raise_error` now correctly considers successful compilation an error
- Puppet's `modulepath` can now contain multiple entries and rspec-puppet will configure puppet to load code from all of them
- Support running with rspec 2.99 again
- non-class resources are now covered by the coverage code
- Fix #323/MODULES-2374: autorequires checking doesn't abort on "undefined method \`[]' for nil:NilClass"
- improved documentation for hiera integration, added example spec
- document the `scope` property
